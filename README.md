# Basic--ScrumTable

Here we are with our "Software Construction Final Project" also known as Huddle. My classmate (Furkan Dogu) and I have developed a basic scrum table that have functions below

- Saving user stories
- Saving tasks
- Drag&drop between phases <br>

We also used Singleton Design Pattern in our main class to avoid passing references between forms and classes. In Huddle it is possible to create more than one projects. The projects may have different owners, deadlines and responsible people.

Since user control makes creating custom controls and  including them in a project, we used it for task and user stories

Finally, we want to thank you our instructor Emin Borandag who has given homeworks that helps us expand our horizons in programming.
